# Hangman challenge

1. **Rename** Hangman.MyVersion.Core to whatever you like (change *MyVersion* to something else)

2. Create a test project **Hangman.MyVersion.Core.Test** that should test your code in *Hangman.MyVersion.Core*

3. Continue on the class **Hangman.cs** in the Core-project and make your own test pass + the approval tests pass. You may add as many types (classes, enum etc.) as you want.

4. When all tests pass, create a **Console-app** that uses your Core-project

5. **Extra:** Create on or more project that uses you Core-project:
   * Winforms-app
   * WPF-app
   * Website
